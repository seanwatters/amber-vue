# Amber with Vue.js

The goal of the Amber with Vue.js recipe is to quickly provide a full stack solution that takes full advantages of the best parts of development using a frontend framework (in the way it was designed to be used), with a powerful backend API.

The goal of the **Amber with Vue.js** recipe is to quickly provide a full stack solution that takes full advantages of the best parts of development using a frontend framework (in the way it was designed to be used), with a powerful backend API.

The intention is to break away from the traditional Rails-y MVC model, without requiring developers to write completely separate frontend/backend codebases. 

<br>

## Creating a Project

To create your project with the **amber-vue** recipe, you will need to run the following command: 

```
amber new <your app name> -r seanwatters/amber-vue
```

You may also want to specify your database (default is Postgres) by adding the `-d` tag:

```
amber new <your app name> -r seanwatters/amber-vue -d <pg | mysql | sqlite>
```

Once your app has been created, you will want to run

```
cd <your app name>
amber w
```

Your application will be running on `localhost:9090`.

<br>

## File Structure

With this recipe, we have modularized the file structure to isolate your frontend code in Vue.js from your Amber API.

```
|- bin
|- config
|- db
|- frontend-vue   // Vue.js file tree structure.
    |- src
        |- assets
        |- components
            |- HelloWorld.vue
        |- App.vue
    |- main.js
    
|- lib
|- public
|- spec
|- src
    |- controllers
        |- application_controller.cr  // the root is rendered here
        
    |- locales
    |- models
    |- views
        |- layouts
        |- application
            |- application.slang   // Location of the root #app <div> Vue will render to.
         
```

<br>

## CLI

The **amber-vue-cli** is a tool for scaffolding APIs, and components. To use the CLI, you will need to install the tool with `npm install` and run:

```
npm run vue-tools
```

When you run the CLI, you should see the following:

```
? select generator
> componenet  // vue component generator
> scaffold  // **currently doesn't have full functionality**
> api  // will generate a full CRUD API in amber
```

You can generate components, full CRUD scaffolds and JSON APIs. 

Please feel free to reference the **amber-vue-cli** [docs](https://github.com/seanwatters/amber-vue-cli) for a more in depth breakdown!

## Documentation

For any questions specific to the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) or [Amber](https://amberframework.org/) frameworks, please feel free to refer to their excellent documentation below:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
* [Amber](https://docs.amberframework.org/amber/)

## DevTools

When developing Vue.js applications, it is highly recommended to use the [Vue.js devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools). Currently only FireFox and Chrome have support for the devtools extension. Their links are provided below:

* FireFox: [devtools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)
* Chrome: [devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)

You can also use the standalone Electron app **vue-remote-devtools** for any enviornment:

* Remote: [devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/blob/master/shells/electron/README.md)
